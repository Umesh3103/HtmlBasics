        <p>War robots is a mobile game in which you have robots in you hanger and you have to fight with opponent robots in different modes like br,tdm,domination,ffa. It was launched in 2014 and was the best game till 2018 bcz then this game turned into a p2w game,where with each update more and more op stuffs are there and any f2p player can't get that. You have to spend a lot of money in the game just to be competetive and now it's almost dead.</p>
